## Out-of-the-Box Bytecode Cache

PHP is an interpreted language. The default PHP runtime compiles PHP sourcecode to an intermediate representation called PHP bytecode which is then executed. A bytecode cache stores this compiled representation of PHP sourcecode in shared memory. This eliminates the need to load and compile sourcecode on each request which leads to a significant increase in performance (up to 70% more requests per second).

The basic idea, when executing a PHP script is in two steps:

* First: the PHP code, written in plain-text, is **compiled to opcodes**
* Then: those **opcodes are executed**.

When you have one PHP script, as long as it is not modified, the opcodes will always be the same ; so, doing the compilation phase each time that script is to be executed is kind of a waste of CPU-time.

To prevent that redundant-compilation, there are some opcode caching mechanism that you can use.

Once the PHP script has been compiled to opcodes, those will be kept in RAM -- and directly used from memory the next time the script is to be executed ; preventing the compilation from being done again and again.

## Installation

```
composer require odan/cache
```

## Usage

```php
$cachePath = sys_get_temp_dir() . '/cache';

$cache = new \Odan\Cache\Simple\OpCache($cachePath);

// set a opcache value
$cache->set('foo', 'bar');

// get a opcache value
echo $cache->get('foo'); // bar
```

## Known issues

> Fatal error: Call to undefined method stdClass::__set_state()

If there are objects in the value, they will be written as `stdClass::__set_state()`. 
This is fine for objects where __set_state() can be added, but it can't be added to stdClass.

To fix this issue just serialize the value you are trying to cache:

```php
$cache->set('key', serialize($object));
```

Then unserialize the string back to the original value:

```php
$object = unserialize($cache->get('key'));
```

### Race conditions

If you're in a high-concurrency environment you should avoid using a filesystem cache. 
Multiple operations on the file system are very hard to make atomic in PHP.
